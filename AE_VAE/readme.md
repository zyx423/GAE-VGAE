This is my reproduced AutoEncoder and variational AutoEncoder by the Pytorch. If you find any errors or questions, please tell me.

1. There are three tasks used to evaluate the effect of graph embedding, i.e., node clustering, node classification, and graph visualization.
   Algorithms used in the tasks.

* Clustering：k-means;
* Classification: SVM;
* Visualization: t-SNE;

2. Requirement: Ptthon 3.7, Pytorch: 1.5 and other pakeages which is illustrated in the code. And the codes can be runned in the windows.
3. This is a code file containing the AutoEncoder（AE） and variational AutoEncoder（VAE）. The purpose of this case is mainly to learn the latent representation.
4. If you think my code is helpful to you, please light me a star, thank you.
