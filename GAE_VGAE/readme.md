  This is my reproduced code for the paper:  T. N. Kipf, M. Welling, "Variational graph auto-encoders," arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.07308, 2016.
If you find any errors or questions, please tell me.

1. There are four tasks used to evaluate the effect of graph embedding, i.e., node clustering, node classification, link prediction， and graph visualization.
   Algorithms used in the tasks.

* Clustering：k-means;
* Classification: SVM;
* Link prediction;
* Visualization: t-SNE;

2. Requirement: Ptthon 3.7, Pytorch: 1.5 and other pakeages which is illustrated in the code. And the codes can be runned in the windows.
3. This is a code file containing the Graph AutoEncoder（AE） and Graph Variational AutoEncoder（VAE）. The purpose of this case is mainly to learn the latent representation(embeddding).
4. If you think my code is helpful to you, please light me a star, thank you.
