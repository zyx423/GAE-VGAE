  This is my reproduced code for the paper:  T. N. Kipf, M. Welling, "Variational graph auto-encoders," arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.07308, 2016.
If you find any errors or questions, please tell me.

1. The purpose of this algorithm is mainly to learn the latent representation(embeddding). 
To evaluate the effect of the method, there are three tasks used for the tset experimen, i.e., node clustering, node classification, and graph visualization.
   Algorithms used in the tasks.
* Clusteringï¼šk-means;
* Classification: SVM;
* Visualization: t-SNE;

2. Requirement: Ptthon 3.7, Pytorch: 1.5 and other pakeages which is illustrated in the code. And the codes can be runned in the windows.
3. If you think my code is helpful to you, please light me a star, thank you.
